# arc.lang, an esolang using my username!

The only valid instruction is `arc`  
buuuuuut...  
✨ captialization ✨  
## Theory:

There are two things in arc, the stack, and the operating var, the op var is a place in stack.
You can move around the opperating var

## Instructions:

| code | instruction                |
|------|----------------------------|
| arc  | increment op               |
| aRc  | decrement op               |
| Arc  | move op up in stack        |
| arC  | move op down in stack      |
| ARc  | increment op by stack down |
| aRC  | decrement op by stack down |
| ARC  | print out stack as ascii   |
